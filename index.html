      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello! My name is Jonathan Tayts and I am excited to dive into programming over the next few months. I look forward to work closely with everyone trying to expand their knowledge of programming. We are in this together!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>On November 14, 2000 a happy accident entered this world at Saint Peters University Hospital in New Brunswick. Soon afterwards I was taken to Highland Park, NJ where I spent the past two decades growing into the person I am today. Living in a diverse area that is densely populated within a 1.8 square mile location fueled my creativity, humbled me, and opened my eyes to the oppurtunities in life. </p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Over the course of my life I have developed many hobbies ranging from tennis to chess. One hobby I take passion in on a daily basis is volunteering for the Highland Park First Aid Squad. Whenever someone in Highland Park needs an ambulance we are dispatched. I get to work closely with neighboring hospital systems, first responders, and people that are calling at their worst times. The twelve hour shifts helped build character, and the good feeling of doing what is right for no gain helped develop me into a strong individual. One that is kind, caring, compassionate, but most of all an advocate for improvements within the healthcare system.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream is to one day start my own company and capitilize on the shaky healthcare system we have. There is constant change in healthcare and technology with many opportunities. I would love to integrate what I learn from this day forward and apply it to the healthcare system in an effective manner. </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently reside in Highland Park, NJ. </p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Too often we hear about immoral and corrupt leaders of the tech and health industry. I want to make a change to that by starting with the building blocks of programming and improving.</p>
